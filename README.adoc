*Special note for recruiters*

// I already like you, because you can and care to read source code and
// comments. Some content here has been hidden from always busy people.
// Lecturing them is not worth it. I hope you will find the information useful.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-t-a8a62a197/[LinkedIn]:

* Provide a focused job description, then I will send you my CV.
* Sending a request before we've had a conversation is an instant `-1`. I'll add you temporarily and remove you later.
* Don't expect a reply if you mistake me for a Windows or Network engineer.
* If you rely on non-verbal cues during phone communication for every step of the recruitment process, I will switch to email communication instead.
// ** I don't want to have any more dangerous phone calls while commuting.
// ** I don't want to have to piece together what a call was about.
// ** I value introverted and sensitive personalities in the workplace but prefer not to work with overly extroverted individuals who struggle with written communication.
// * I have a profile, but I don't participate in any social media activities.
// * STFU & GTD is my preferred professional representation.

Xing:

* I prefer LinkedIn. Think of my LinkedIn profile as the complete version of my Xing profile.
* I might miss your message since I've turned off all unnecessary and intrusive notifications.

Thank you for your time.

== For everyone else

Things I love:

* FOSS / FLOSS
* Linux: Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Android, ChromeOS, OpenWrt, Arch Linux
* Automation

Social Media:

* https://stackexchange.com/users/1149008[StackExchange / StackOverflow]:
  I have been more active some years ago and wrote a few answers, particularly for Ubuntu, which became quite popular.
* Twitter/X:
  Waste of time from my point of view.
  Was useful when it was an open platform. R.I.P.
* Instagram/WhatsApp/Facebook/Meta Platforms:
  Waste of time from my point of view.
  Has never been an open platform, just a conditioning chamber.
  I prefer to share photos only with friends and family.
